Ride Sharing App
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
By sharing a seat with people during driving, the number of vehicles on the 
traffic is reduced, thereby achieving the purpose of reducing CO2 emissions.
App's main functions include:
1) Let users send out the demand for finding a ride.
2) Users who provide ride sharing services can help 
   find the above needs through tables and filters,
   then confirm the ride sharing services.
3) Every time a ride sharing service is completed, the system will calculate 
   the CO2 reduction achieved due to the shared ride, and will sum the data 
   to the statistics on the main page.
